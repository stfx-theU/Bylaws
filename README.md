## New Bylaw System

Advantages:
- All changes are publicly viewable. For any change you can see:
  - Why it occured: all changes require a comment describing the change, relevant council date can also be included here
  - What lines (exactly) were added and removed
  - When it was first drafted (on an alternative branch, not "Master")
  - Who first proposed the change
  - When it was officially merged to Master
  - Who ultimately commits the change
- Public version is the master copy (openness, reduced need for formal publishing)
- Built in issue system for tracking the resolution of problems or questions about the bylaws. Many other also use this as a task list. (built-in productivity tool)
- Easy to demonstrate current state and/or proposed changes to others (e.g. council meetings)
